# Recon Project Management System - Project Document

## Project Overview

Recon is a comprehensive construction project management system inspired by ProCore. It provides tools for managing construction projects, tasks, documents, team members, and budgets. The application is built with modern web technologies and follows best practices for security, performance, and user experience.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for UI development
- **Vite** for fast build tooling
- **CSS** for styling (custom CSS with no framework)
- **React Router** for navigation and routing

### Backend
- **Supabase** for:
  - Authentication and user management
  - PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Storage for document management

### DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker** for containerization and local development
- **GitHub** for version control and CI/CD
- **Netlify** for frontend hosting and deployment
- **Supabase Cloud** for backend services
