          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At Recon, we're on a mission to transform how construction and engineering teams manage their projects. 
            We believe that with the right tools, teams can reduce delays, minimize cost overruns, and deliver 
            exceptional results for their clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our platform combines powerful project management capabilities with intuitive design, making it easy 
            for teams of all sizes to plan, execute, and track their projects from start to finish.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Recon was founded in 2020 by a team of construction professionals and software engineers who were 
            frustrated with the existing project management solutions on the market. They saw an opportunity to 
            create something betterâ€”a platform specifically designed for the unique challenges of construction 
            and engineering projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a simple tool for tracking tasks and deadlines has evolved into a comprehensive 
            project management platform used by thousands of professionals around the world. Today, Recon 
            continues to innovate and expand, driven by our commitment to helping teams build better.
